I have used 5 global string variables to be accessed throughout the program. If you want to change the appearance of the dice in future, you can edit this strings
side_1() to side_6() are the functions depicting the different sides of the dice
The function Choice allows you to print the different sides of the dice as and when required
The funtion Into() depicts the screen of options that would appear before the start of the program
dikha_jalwa() is just to make the program look better
decide() is to decide the score of the game
